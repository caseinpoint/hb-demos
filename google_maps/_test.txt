Set up db
    >>> from server import db, connect_to_db, app
    >>> from seed import get_bears
    >>> import os

    >>> drop = os.system("dropdb bears --if-exists")
    >>> os.system("createdb bears")

Create tables and populate database. Only 50 bears are added to the db.
    >>> connect_to_db(app)
    >>> db.create_all()
    >>> get_bears()
    0 bears have been added to this database
    10 bears have been added to this database
    20 bears have been added to this database
    30 bears have been added to this database
    40 bears have been added to this database
    50 bears have been added to this database

Check bear data route
    >>> client = app.test_client()
    >>> r = client.get('/bears.json')
    >>> assert b'["1":{"bearId":"1737","birthYear":"1970",' in r.data

Links to demos are in index
    >>> r = client.get('/')
    >>> assert b'<a href="/map/basic">' in r.data
    >>> assert b'<a href="/map/bears">' in r.data

API Key has been sanitized from Google Maps import
    >>> r = client.get('/map/basic')
    >>> assert b '/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE&callback' in r.data

Clean up
    >>> db.session.close()
    >>> db.engine.dispose()
    >>> drop = os.system("dropdb bears")
